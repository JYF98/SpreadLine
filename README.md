# SpreadLine
A visualization design framework that supports the exploration of dynamic multivariate networks from the egocentric perspective.

## Notes for reviwers
We will update documentation very soon. As of now, `sample.py` provides the simplest case with toy data to show how framework users can use SpreadLine. In `case-studies/`, we have shared the data of our case studies, where `demo/` contains an interactive web app that allows people to reproduce the result.

## Python Installation
