# SpreadLine
A visualization design framework that supports the exploration of dynamic multivariate networks from the egocentric perspective.

## Introduction
- Source code can be found in `./SpreadLine`
- Sample script of using SpreadLine refers to `./sample.py`
- `supplementary_materials.pdf` contains 5 major sections: (A) Examples of different optimization focuses, optimization details, and two more discussions on design choices; (B) Interface of using SpreadLine; (C) Data structures of all three case studies and their associated ChatGPT prompts for data processing (if there is any); (D) Self-reported participant background & additional usability study details; (E) Two more SpreadLine representations of visualization researchers on a larger data scale.
- `./case-studies` provide the datasets used in SpreadLine representations.
- `./demo` contains a vanilla web application that computes and renders SpreadLine representations.

## Python Installation
Run this to use SpreadLine as demonstrated in `./sample.py`
```
pip install .
```


## Roadmap
- Code documentations and cleanup.
